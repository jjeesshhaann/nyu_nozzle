The design process begins with determining the area of the throat. The throat should be designed such to choke the flow, and is given by Eqn 13.136 in https://engineering.purdue.edu/~wassgren/teaching/ME30800/NotesAndReading/CompressibleFlow_ConvergingNozzle_Reading.pdf.

The area of the throat is based on the desired mass flow rate, which comes from the thrust and specific impulse of the engine.
